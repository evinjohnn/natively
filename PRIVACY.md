# Privacy Policy for Natively

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

Welcome to Natively ("we," "our," or "us"). Natively is an open-source project available on GitHub. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to the Natively codebase and community.

## Open Source Nature

Natively is an open-source project. This means:

1.  **Code Transparency:** The source code is publicly available for inspection. You can review the code to understand exactly what it does and does not do with your data.
2.  **Self-Hosted:** If you download and run Natively on your own infrastructure or device, no data is sent to the project maintainers unless you explicitly configure it to do so. You are the controller of your own data instance.

## Information We Collect

### From Contributors
When you contribute to the Natively project (e.g., by submitting code, opening issues, or commenting on pull requests) on platforms like GitHub:
*   **Public Information:** Your username, profile information, and the content of your contributions (code, comments) become publicly available as part of the project's history.
*   **Metadata:** Git commit metadata (which may include your name and email address) is permanently recorded in the project's version history.

### From Users of the Software
The default Natively software configuration does not collect personal information from users and send it to the project maintainers. However:
*   **Third-Party Deployment:** If you use a hosted version of Natively provided by a third party, that third party is responsible for their own privacy practices.
*   **Optional Telemetry:** If the software includes optional telemetry or crash reporting, it will be disabled by default or clearly opt-in. (Check documentation for specific configuration options).

## Third-Party Services

The Natively project is hosted on GitHub. Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for information on how they collect and use data from visitors to their platform.

If you deploy Natively using third-party services (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS), those services may collect logs and usage data according to their own privacy policies.

## Cookies and Tracking

The core Natively open-source project code does not include tracking cookies or analytics scripts by default.

## Security

We take security seriously. However, as an open-source project provided "as is," we cannot guarantee absolute security. Vulnerabilities should be reported responsibly (see our Security Policy if available, otherwise open a private inquiry).

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
